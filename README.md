# Creia

Creia is a modern real-time collaboration platform built for teams who want to create, plan, and communicate in one clean workspace. It brings messaging, task management, and file sharing together inside a simple, focused interface designed for fast teamwork.

## ✨ What is Creia?

Creia gives teams a shared space where everything happens in real time. Whether you're chatting, updating tasks on a Kanban board, or organizing files, everyone sees changes instantly. No switching between apps, no confusion — just smooth flow.

## 🚀 Key Features
